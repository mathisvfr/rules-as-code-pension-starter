# Rules as Code – Pension Lump-Sum Starter Template

Welcome to the **Rules as Code Hackathon** starter repository!

This template helps teams explore how pension lump-sum decisions can be modeled, explained, and made transparent using code.

## What is Rules as Code?

Rules as Code is an approach where legislation, policies, or administrative rules are written in both human-readable and machine-executable formats. The goal is to improve clarity, consistency, and accessibility of public services.

## What's in this Repository?

| Folder/File | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `data/Hackathon_profiles.yaml` | Fictional pension profiles for testing your solution |
| `rules/` | Place your rule logic here (calculations, decision trees, etc.) |
| `examples/` | Example scenarios and questions to explore |

## The Challenge

Participants will build tools that help citizens understand their **pension lump-sum options**. The focus is on:

- **Explainability** – Can a user understand *why* a recommendation is made?
- **Transparency** – Are the rules and assumptions clearly documented?
- **Accessibility** – Can non-technical users benefit from the tool?

## How to Use This Template

1. Click **"Use this template"** on GitHub to create your own copy
2. Explore the sample profiles in `data/Hackathon_profiles.yaml`
3. Add your rule logic in the `rules/` folder
4. Document your assumptions and approach
5. Build a prototype (CLI, web app, notebook, etc.)

## Guidelines

- **Assumptions are allowed** – Real pension rules are complex. Document any simplifications you make.
- **Focus on explainability** – Your solution should help users understand their options, not just compute numbers.
- **Mixed teams welcome** – This challenge is designed for developers, policy experts, designers, and domain specialists working together.
- **Keep it simple** – A clear, working prototype is better than an over-engineered solution.

## Important Disclaimer

> ⚠️ **This is a hackathon challenge only.**

> The profiles in this repository are **fictional**. Any calculations or advice produced by solutions built on this template are **non-binding** and should not be used for real financial decisions.
